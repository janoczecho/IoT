# 🎓 My IoT Studies @ Warsaw University of Technology

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is my personal hub for everything related to my **IoT (Internet of Things)** studies at **Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska)**.

You'll find all kinds of stuff here — from project code 🧑‍💻, reports 📄, to lab notes 🧪 and random helpful things I don't want to lose 😄.
